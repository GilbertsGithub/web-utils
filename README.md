# Web Utilities
Small utilities sometimes useful to web development. 

Beware that some of these may be old and or ugly, but they have the advantage of working for me. 

## Available Files

1. cgibinIntercept.sh: cgi-bin debugging aid
  Have a misbehaving cgi-bin? Wrote this tool long ago that assures developers always get a useful information returned to them.

 * If the cgi-bin fails severely a diagnostic page is returned showing much details.
 * A log file is also created that logs both the input to the web browser and the output from the cgi-bin.

  Stay within the limits and the program can be useful. 

  Documentation is found within the script itself.
